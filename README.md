## Building the Project

So far the application was only developed in Android and so we didn't upload it to Play Store. 
To run the application, the project has to be opened in Unity and built into you're andriod smartphone. Make sure you have Vuforia package imported and added to Virtual Reality SDKs in Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> XR Settings. 
Some other configurations you can take into account is to use Android 4.4 Kit Kat as Minimum API Level and uncheck Android TV Compatibility in Player -> Other Settings.

## How to play APPlica-te

At this point we will assume that you already have the application built and ready to run on your andriod phone.
The first step is to download the images below. They will be needed as targets to trigger the Aumented Reality in the application. The Menu target image is placed on the ground to be used as a target to trigger the menu in-game and the Cursor target is placed in the the user's foot to trigger the cursor in-game. 
This is a Virtual Reality game with Foot Menu and so the menu is only displayed when you look down. To select an option, you're foot, witch containts the cursor in-game, has to be put on top of the desired option. 
Follow the instructions and good luck. Have a great Game!!!
